This folder contains counts data from evolution experiments. Rows correspond to barcodes (inferred and clustered using Bartender: https://github.com/LaoZZZZZ/bartender-1.1), and columns correspond to measured timepoints, which are labeled as number of generations. Barcodes with few counts across few timepoints were eliminated (usually in the neighborhood of less than 3 counts across 3 timepoints). Conditions are labeled as follows:

G / SE_Glu: Glucose
SE_Gal: Galactose
L: Lactose
H: H2O2
N / SE_NaCl: NaCl
SE_Gal-F: Fluctuating Glucose/Galactose
L-F-1 / L-F-2: Fluctuating Glucose/Lactate
H-F-1 / H-F-2: Fluctuating Glucose/H2O2
N-F / SE_NaCl-F: Fluctuating Glucose/NaCl
H-N-1 / H-N-2: Fluctuating H2O2/NaCl
