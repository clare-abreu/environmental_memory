Code and data for Abreu et al. (2024) Nature Ecology &amp; Evolution

The repository contains two folders: code and data.

The code folder contains code to reproduce Figs. 2 - 5 from the main text, as well as to generate the estimate listed in Supplementary Fig. 10. The subfolder infer_fitness contains code for inferring fitness of mutants based on raw frequency data, and formatting these fitness inferences for plotting in the figures.

The data folder contains frequency data from the fitness measurements and summary data with fitness inferences and other characteristics of the barcoded mutants. The subfolder WGS contains data from whole-genome sequencing plotted in Fig. 5.
