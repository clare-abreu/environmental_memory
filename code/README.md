This folder contains the code used in Abreu et al (Nature Ecology & Evolution, 2024).

The subfolder infer_fitness contains code for inferring fitness of mutants based on raw frequency data, and formatting these fitness inferences for plotting in the figures.

The files included here are:

# figure2.py:
This figure plots: A) non-additivity in three fluctuating environments, B-D) a few individual barcoded mutant trajectories (averaged across replicate fitness measurements) against the expected trajectories based on static environment fitness, E) all values of non-additivity across all mutants in all fluctuating environments, F) all values of environmental memory, G-H) non-additivity and memory significance scores.
